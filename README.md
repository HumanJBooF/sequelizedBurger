# sequelizedBurger

### Check out the live version on heroku
**[Eat-Da-Burger](https://eat-dat-sequelized-burg.herokuapp.com/burgers)**

## Description 

This app is an updated version of my eat-da-burgers app, except this time its using sequelize. you can add burgers to the available burgers sections, and _devourer_ burgers by clicking them sending them to the _devoured_ section. _Don't_ like a burger? Click it again in the devoured section to get rid of it for good! The app follows MVC design patterns. Everytime you _eat_ an available burger you send a POST request to the database, allowing it to update for you in real time! Same with clicking a _devoured_ burger!
